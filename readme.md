## Email Validation Regex Pattern README

This README provides an in-depth explanation of the regular expression used for validating email addresses, adhering to the RFC 5322 standard.

## Overview

This regular expression aims to validate email addresses by confirming their compliance with the RFC 5322 standard. The pattern is designed to cover various aspects, ensuring a comprehensive and accurate validation process.

## Regex Pattern

regex
^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$
In the following Gist, the pattern is broken down into its components and explained in detail.

## Components
Anchors
^: Denotes the start of the string.
"$": Denotes the end of the string.

## Quantifiers
+: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.

## Character Classes
Three character classes define valid characters:

[A-Za-z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_{|}~-]`: Matches letters (upper/lowercase), digits, and specific symbols.
[A-Za-z0-9.-]: Matches letters, digits, dots, and hyphens.
[a-zA-Z]: Matches single uppercase or lowercase letters.

## Grouping and Capturing
Two capturing groups ensure the validation of characters:

([a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_{|}~-]+)`: Captures characters before the '@' symbol.
([a-zA-Z0-9-]+): Captures characters after the '@' symbol, validating the domain.

## Bracket Expressions
([^a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]): Ensures that invalid characters are not present before '@'.

## Greedy Match
+: Indicates a greedy match, capturing as many characters as possible.

## Back-references
\1: Refers to the first capturing group's match, ensuring repetition of characters before '@'.

## Look-ahead and Look-behind
(?=...): Ensures a position is followed by specific characters.
(?<=...): Ensures a position is preceded by specific characters.

## Usage
This regex pattern is suitable for validating email addresses according to the RFC 5322 standard. Integration into your application or system can enhance email input validation, ensuring adherence to established standards.
